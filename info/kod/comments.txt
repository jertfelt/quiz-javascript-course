Method: 
I chose to loop out the object instead of manually creating each button and answer, and I have done it in different ways (and failed miserably) until I found some alternative ways. However, for the multiple choices, I have done it in HTML, as I can practise both on course materials and new things.

Join(): (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Globalt_Objects/Array/join) a neat way to push in the array elements as string objects, and it seems to work although I do not 100% comprehend it. 

I also tried to add divs with images as I loop out the "ordinary questions", but found it hard to add them, below doesn't work: 
  <div class="images${questNumb}"></div>
let imageRapunzel = document.getElementsByClassName("images0");
imageRapunzel.firstChild.innerHTML = `<img src="https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/q_omd_q2-image2_ddt-17141_e496fab5.jpeg?width=666" width="200px">
